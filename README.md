# Animal Feeder

Animal Feeder is a 3D game created in Unity where animals randomly come from the front and both sides of the screen, and the player's objective is to feed them by moving side-to-side and back-and-forth. The animals have different levels of hunger, and the player is rewarded different scores for feeding different animals. However, if an animal hits the player or walks past the camera unfed, the player loses a life. The game is over when the player loses all three lives. You can Play this game on [my itch.io page](https://aliqadir.itch.io/project-2) in the browser or download the executable file for Windows or MacOS.

## How to Play

-   Use the arrow keys or A/D keys to move left and right, W/S keys to move forwards and backwards.
-   As the animals approach, use the space bar to toss food in their direction.
-   Be sure to feed each animal before they walk past the camera or you will lose one life.
-   You have three lives in total, and the game ends when you lose them all.

Different animals have different levels of hunger, so feeding each animal will reward you with a different score. The game also features random spawning of animals from the front and both sides, so you'll need to be alert and quick on your feet.
